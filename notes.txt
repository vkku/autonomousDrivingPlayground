Note: If you are reading in an image using mpimg.imread() this will read in an RGB image and you should convert to grayscale using cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY, but if you are using cv2.imread() or the glob API, as happens in this video example, this will read in a BGR image and you should convert to grayscale using cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY

# Use cv2.Laplacian()
